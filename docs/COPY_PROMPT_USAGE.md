## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complex Test Failure
**Use:** Copy Full Prompt
**Situation:** A test fails with multiple errors and you need comprehensive analysis
**AI Request:** "Analyze this test failure and provide a complete solution with code examples"

### Scenario 2: Quick Fix Needed
**Use:** Quick Analysis
**Situation:** A simple locator issue that needs immediate attention
**AI Request:** "What's the quickest way to fix this locator problem?"

### Scenario 3: Debugging Guidance
**Use:** Debug Help
**Situation:** You need to understand how to debug a specific issue
**AI Request:** "Help me debug this step by step and show me how to reproduce it"

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå **Copy Button Not Visible:**
- **Cause:** Copy Prompt buttons only appear on **failed tests**
- **Solution:** Navigate to a failed test to see the buttons

### ‚ùå **Copy Failed:**
- **Cause:** Browser security restrictions or clipboard API issues
- **Solution:** Try refreshing the page or using a different browser

### ‚ùå **Prompt Not Complete:**
- **Cause:** Test data might be incomplete
- **Solution:** Check that the test has proper annotations and error information

## Technical Details

### **Prompt Generation:**
- Prompts are generated by the `PromptGenerator` class
- Data is extracted from Playwright test results and annotations
- Prompts are structured for optimal AI consumption

### **Clipboard Integration:**
- Uses modern Clipboard API when available
- Falls back to `document.execCommand('copy')` for older browsers
- Handles secure context requirements

### **Attachment Handling:**
- References attachment files without including content
- Keeps prompts lightweight and focused
