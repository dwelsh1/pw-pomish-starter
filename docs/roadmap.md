## üéâ **Conclusion**

This roadmap balances **innovation with simplicity**, ensuring the Specs Reporter remains:
- **Simple to use** - No complex setup or configuration
- **Very useful** - Powerful features that solve real problems
- **Unique** - AI-powered Copy Prompt remains our differentiator
- **Maintainable** - Clean architecture and focused scope

The phased approach allows us to **deliver value quickly** while building toward a **comprehensive but not complex** reporting solution.

**Remember**: Our goal is to be the **best developer-focused** Playwright reporter, not the most feature-rich enterprise solution. üöÄ
